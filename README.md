Solves Rubiks cubes using OpenCV

# Color Identification
I used OpenCV to convert the captured frames from my computer to the HSV color scheme and identified color based on the hue. I then found the color density in each square of the rubiks cube to identify the squares overall color and used the kociemba python module (https://github.com/muodov/kociemba) to solve the cube given its color scheme.
